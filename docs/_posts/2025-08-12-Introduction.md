Hello everyone, my name is Vu Hoang Nhat Anh, currently a junior major in Artificial Intelligence at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. This is a blog that i want to focus on my journey to dive deeper in the field of AI, further than what i learn in school. 

Many appreciation for Mr.Luc, my soon-retired boss at FPT Smart Cloud, who encourages us interns to write a blog. He wants us to focus on the problems, and everytime we write a post like this, we must sit down, think about it, therfore, create a fluent thinking process, which will further be enhanced to problem-solving ability.
